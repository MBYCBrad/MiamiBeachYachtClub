# Git Sync Commands - Run these in your Shell

# Option 1: Pull and merge (Recommended)
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
# If there are conflicts, resolve them then:
git add .
git commit -m "merge: Resolve conflicts with remote repository"
git push origin main

# Option 2: Force push (Use with caution - will overwrite remote)
# Only use this if you're sure your local version is the correct one
git push -f origin main

# Option 3: Create a new branch and push
git checkout -b new-main
git push -u origin new-main
# Then create a pull request on GitHub to merge new-main into main
