# LUXURY YACHT 3D MODEL - EXACT REPLICA PLAN

## Reference Analysis from Sketchfab Model
Based on the screenshot, the yacht has:
- Multi-level superstructure with distinct deck layers
- White/grey hull with sharp angular design
- Multiple deck levels stacked vertically
- Dark tinted windows on superstructure
- Brown/wood colored deck areas
- Blue accent details (possibly water line)
- Metallic/chrome details and railings
- Complex geometry with beveled edges

## Implementation Strategy: Layer-by-Layer Construction

### PHASE 1: HULL CONSTRUCTION (Layers 1-100)
1. Main hull body - swept profile with sharp bow
2. Hull sides - port and starboard with complex curves
3. Hull bottom - V-shaped with keel line
4. Bow section - sharp angular point
5. Stern section - squared off with swim platform cutout
6. Chine lines - sharp edges where hull meets sides
7. Spray rails - horizontal ridges along hull
8. Hull windows - portholes along sides
9. Anchor pockets - recessed areas at bow
10. Through-hull fittings - detailed openings

### PHASE 2: DECK LEVELS (Layers 101-300)
1. Lower deck platform
2. Main deck - full length with complex shape
3. Upper deck - shorter, centered
4. Flybridge deck - top level
5. Deck edges - rounded gunwales
6. Deck camber - slight curve for water runoff
7. Non-skid surfaces - textured areas
8. Deck drains - scuppers at edges
9. Deck hatches - access panels
10. Deck joints - expansion joints

### PHASE 3: SUPERSTRUCTURE (Layers 301-600)
1. Main cabin base structure
2. Window frames - individual frames
3. Window glass - tinted panels
4. Cabin sides - angular panels
5. Cabin roof - multi-level
6. Radar arch - swept design
7. Hardtop - flybridge cover
8. Support pillars - structural columns
9. Air vents - louvers and grilles
10. Access doors - sliding/hinged

### PHASE 4: DETAILS (Layers 601-1000+)
1. Railings - stainless steel tubing
2. Stanchions - vertical posts
3. Cleats - mooring hardware
4. Windshield wipers
5. Navigation lights
6. Antennas - VHF, radar, satellite
7. Horns - air horns
8. Searchlights
9. Deck furniture
10. Life raft canisters
... and hundreds more detail elements

## Technical Approach
- Use BufferGeometry for complex hull curves
- Implement CSG operations for boolean cuts
- Create parametric functions for repeated elements
- Use instanced geometry for railings/stanchions
- Implement LOD system for performance
- Build modular component system
