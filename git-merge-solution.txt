# Run these commands in order:

# 1. Configure Git to use merge strategy
git config pull.rebase false

# 2. Pull with unrelated histories
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories

# 3. If there are merge conflicts, they'll likely be in README.md
# Open the conflicted files and resolve them, then:
git add .
git commit -m "merge: Sync local repository with GitHub"

# 4. Push the merged changes
git push origin main

# Alternative: If the above doesn't work, force push your local version
# (This will overwrite the remote completely)
git push -f origin main
